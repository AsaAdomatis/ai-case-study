# Case Study: The Earth Species Project

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
    * The Earth Species Project

* When was the company incorporated?
    * Founded in 2017

* Who are the founders of the company?
    * Britt Selvitelle, Katie Zacarian, and Aza Raskin
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * The founders Selvitelle and Raskin met and bonded in 2007. Then, in 2013 Raskin heard an NPR story about human-like vocalizations from the Gelada Monkey. Afterwards, Selvitelle and Razkin took to nature to begin to study bioacoustics. Later, they joined Zacarian to officialy start the project.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    * The company is a 501c3 nonprofit meaning it's funded by donations

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * ESP (Earth Science Project) is trying to use the recent NLP (natural language processing) technology to decode non-human language. They've worked with animals such as rhesus macaques, bottlenose dolphins, Egyptian fruit bats, dogs, humpback whales, sperm whales, and elephants.
    * As for specific projects, ESP is focused on creating benchmarks, using AI to automatically discover behavior of animals through large scale tracking operations, training self-supervised foundation models, and establishing semantic generation and communication editing.
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * As a nonprofit, ESP doesn't have a traditional customer base, but it does have a variety of stakeholders like conservation organizations, academic organizations, and environmental groups.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * Very few projects are trying to decode animal communication.
    * Compared to the Koko Project, a project designed to pioneer communication between humans and gorillas using Koko the Gorilla, ESP leverages AI.
    * As for Project CETI (Cetcean Translation Initiative), a project focusing on decoding sperm whale communication through AI, ESP still leverages AI more. Project CETI is only in the data collection and statistical analysis phase, so does not use AI methods yet.
    * So in both cases, ESP utilizes AI to best the competition. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * ESP is using a variety of ML models for its AI purposes using unsupervised, supervised, and self-supervised models. Output of the models is then decoded into classifications and cross-modal associations.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
    * Conservation, enviroment, and wildlife
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
    * BEANS (The BEnchmark of ANimal Sounds): a collection of datasates and benchmarks for those sets to be used in the field of bioacoustics.
    * BioCPPNet: A solution to the cocktail party problem.
* What are the other major companies in this field?
    * There is only one other major group in AI-powered non-human communication, Project CETI.
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * The primary impact of of the Earth Species Project has been an increase conservation efforts and multi-modal communication processing.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
    * The primary metric used to measure success in the field of bioacoustics is BEANS as previously mentioned. For the two common AI tasks, classification and detection, Beans defines a metric. The classification metric is a measure of accuracy while the detection metric is measure of mean average precision.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
    * ESP is performing well. Unlike Project CETI, ESP studies a diversity of animals and publishes more often.
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * A large issue of bioacoustics is limited data. It is difficult to get the quality multi-modal data that is needed for decoding animal communication. To generate a more robust dataset, ESP could offer an at home data collection device. For example, a small camera that you could place in your backyard.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * An at home data collection device would allow for the creation of more robust datasets. In one of ESP's projects, they study carrion crows across Europe. An at-home device could gather data on calls and associated behaviors throughout the continent without distrubiting man power to these areas.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * These collection devices would need to utilize a distributed database system as well as some sort of network, cloud or otherwise. The devices themselves would not use any AI or statistical technologies. However, cleaning and utilizing the database would require ML techniques like computer vision to clean the data.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * A distributed database would be necessary for collecting the data across a multinational network of devices.
    * Computer vision would be necessary to identify species and their behaviors captured by these devices.
